Proj-1 is a hands‑on full‑stack learning project that pairs a Flutter frontend with a Django backend to demonstrate building cross‑platform mobile/web UIs and a simple RESTful server (SQLite for local development). The repository includes runnable example code, a small Django app in python_project, and clear setup instructions for creating a Python virtual environment and running both backend and frontend locally — making it easy to experiment, extend, and learn full‑stack workflows. Contributions, feature improvements, and documentation enhancements are welcome.
